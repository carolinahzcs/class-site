      <p>Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a nameless monster. The monster was dying to have a name. So he decided to set out on a journey to find his name.
        But the world was a large place, so the monster split into two on his journey. One monster went to the <a href="pages/he.html">East."</a> And the other went to the <a href="pages/is.html">West."</a> The monster who went East came to a village.
      <p>
      <p>"Mr. Blacksmith, please give me your name."</p>
      <p>"You can't give someone a name."</p>
      <p>"If you give me your name, I'll jump into your stomach and make you strong in return."
      <p>
      <p>"Really? You'll make me stronger? Okay, you can have my name."
      <p>
      <p>And the monster went inside the blacksmith's stomach.</p>
      <p>The monster became Otto the blacksmith. Otto was the strongest man in town. But one day, "Look at me, look at me. The monster inside me has grown this <a href="pages/everyone.html">large.</a>"</p>
      <p>Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp. The hungry monster ate Otto from the inside. He went back to being a monster without a name.</p>
      <p>He jumped into the stomach of Hans the shoemaker, but Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp. He went back to being a monster without a name.</p>
      <p>He jumped into the stomach of Thomas the hunter, but Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble, gulp. And once again he was a monster without a name.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The monster went to a castle to look for a wonderful name.</p>
      <p>"If you give me your name, I'll make you strong."</p>
      <p>"If you'll heal my sickness, I'll give you my name." The monster jumped into the boy's stomach. The king was delighted.</p>
      <p>"The prince is well. The prince is well."</p>
      <p>The monster liked the boy's name. He liked living in the castle. So even when he was hungry, he stayed put.</p>
      <p>Every day he was so hungry, but he stayed put.</p>
      <p>But one day he was just too hungry. "Look at me. Look at me. The monster inside me has grown this <a href="pages/and.html">large,"</a> said the boy. The boy ate the king and and all the servants. Munch-munch, chomp-chomp, gobble-gobble,
        gulp.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>One day, the boy came upon the monster who had gone west.</p>
      <p>"I have a name. It's a wonderful name," said the boy.</p>
      <p>The monster who went west replied, "You don't need a name. You can be happy without a name. Because we are nameless monsters."</p>
      <p>The boy ate the monster who went west. Even though he had finally found a name, there was no one left to call him by it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>What a wonderful name it was,<a href="pages/no-one.html" class="monster">Johan......</a></p>
